<a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/Naruto/">Cruchyroll</a>
<p>An old classic anime. One of the best i have seen. The character build up of this anime is amazing. Naruto shows amazing growth, Sasuke his rival does absolutely great in helping Naruto grow stronger. Kakashi their teacher gives them enough tutoring to guide them steadily and Sakura a very useless girl in the group and in the entire series. Absolutely trash.</p>

<ul>
    <li>She is noisy</li>
    <li>She is annoying</li>
    <li>She does not contribute to the success of missions</li>
</ul>
<h3>Naruto Shippuden</h3>
<p>Another classic in the making. It shows the characters all grown up and ready to face their trails in life. Naruto who left to train with Jiraya is back to the village in hope to find means to save his best friend and rival Sasuke. Naruto faces a lot of pain but does not let any of that stop him from achieving his goal</p>
